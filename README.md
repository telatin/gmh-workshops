### 27th November 2019

:small_blue_diamond: **Introduction to microbiome analysis**
 
_10.30 - Dr. Andrea Telatin (Quadram Institute, Norwich UK)_

What can answers can we get from microbiome analysis? What happens to our samples after DNA extraction? An overview of 16S and metagenomics protocols, from sequencing to the primary bioinformatics analysis.

:small_blue_diamond: **Introduction to RNA-Seq**

_14.00 - Dr. Perla Troncoso Rey (Quadram Institute, Norwich UK)_
 
An overview of transcriptome analysis (RNA-Seq), from sequencing to the primary bioinformatics analysis.
 
### 28th November 2019

:small_blue_diamond:  **Statistical analysis of Transcriptomics datasets**
 
_10.00 - Prof. Chiara Romualdi (University of Padua, Italy)_
 
 Chiara Romualdi is an associate professor of biostatistics at the University of Padua (Italy), and her group has been working on transcriptome analysis for the last 20 years (starting with microarrays). We asked her to deliver a workshop on numerical analysis of transcriptomes. See also: [Romualdi lab website](http://romualdi.bio.unipd.it/)


:small_blue_diamond: **Bioinformatics analysis of 16S experiments, and how to integrate multiple -omics**

_14.00  - Prof. Nicola Vitulo (University of Verona, Italy)_

 Nicola Vitulo is an associate professor of bioinformatics at the University of Verona (Italy). He's currently working on several aspects of microbiome analysis, including novel statistical methods for normalization of metabarcoding contingency tables.
