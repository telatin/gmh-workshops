## :page_with_curl: Program details 


### 27th November 2019

:small_blue_diamond: **Introduction to microbiome analysis**
 
_10.30 - Dr. Andrea Telatin (Quadram Institute, Norwich UK)_

An overview of 16S and metagenomics protocols, from sequencing to the primary bioinformatics analysis.

:small_blue_diamond: **Introduction to RNA-Seq**

_14.00 - Dr. Perla Troncoso Rey (Quadram Institute, Norwich UK)_
 
An overview of transcriptome analysis (RNA-Seq), from sequencing to the primary bioinformatics analysis.
 
### 28th November 2019

:small_blue_diamond:  **Notes on statistical methods for RNA-Seq analysis**
 
_10.00 - Prof. Chiara Romualdi (University of Padua, Italy)_
 


:small_blue_diamond: **Interpreting data from metabarcoding experiments**

_14.00  - Prof. Nicola Vitulo (University of Verona, Italy)_
 
### 9th December 2019 (TBC) 

:small_blue_diamond: **A primer on data analysis with R (or Python)**

_10.00 - Dr. Giovanni Birolo (University of Turin, Italy)_

How do we make sense of datasets? We should probably start using R (and, if we code in Python, Pandas).
With our guest speaker, lead bioinformatician in the [Genomic variation unit](https://www.iigm.it/site/anteprima.php?id_app=1536&t=approfondimento&m=extra&id=337) in Turin, we will demistify the process and see how to start a new numerical workflow.

## Speakers bio

**Chiara Romualdi** is an Associate Professor of biostatistics at the University of Padua (Italy), and her group has been working on transcriptome analysis for the last 20 years (starting with microarrays). We asked her to deliver a workshop on numerical analysis of transcriptomes. See also: [Romualdi lab website](http://romualdi.bio.unipd.it/)

**Nicola Vitulo** is an Associate Professor at the University of Verona, Department of Biotechnology. His work as a computational biologist began on 2002. During these years he had acquired a robust expertise in bioinformatics focusing on gene prediction and annotation, gene expression analysis, comparative genomics and data managment. He had worked for many years in the genomic area developing a strong interest for many aspects of this field, especially focusing on the innovations and challenges introduced by the NGS technologies.
Prof. Vitulo is currently involved in several metagenomics and metabarcoding projects to study the correlation between the composition of the gut microbiota and diseases
