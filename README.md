**Chiara Romualdi** is an Associate Professor at the University of Padova, Department of Biology, and she is PI of a computational biology group since 2005. Her research activity is mostly focused on the development of computational methods for the analysis of transcriptome data in cancer genomics. In the last years, she has worked on the implementation of new methods for pathway and network analysis, with a focus on data integration. She is currently involved in several projects to study cancer heterogeneity and the cross-talk between tumor and immune cells. See also: [Romualdi lab website](http://romualdi.bio.unipd.it/)

**Nicola Vitulo** is an Associate Professor at the University of Verona, Department of Biotechnology. His work as a computational biologist began on 2002. During these years he had acquired a robust expertise in bioinformatics focusing on gene prediction and annotation, gene expression analysis, comparative genomics and data managment. He had worked for many years in the genomic area developing a strong interest for many aspects of this field, especially focusing on the innovations and challenges introduced by the NGS technologies.
Prof. Vitulo is currently involved in several metagenomics and metabarcoding projects to study the correlation between the composition of the gut microbiota and diseases

**Giovanni Birolo** is the lead bioinformatician at the Genome Variation Unit at the University of Turin. After a degree in Maths and a PhD in logic, he joined the exciting field of bioinformatics focusing on population genetics and genomics.
