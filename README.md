**Chiara Romualdi** is an Associate Professor of biostatistics at the University of Padua (Italy), and her group has been working on transcriptome analysis for the last 20 years (starting with microarrays). We asked her to deliver a workshop on numerical analysis of transcriptomes. See also: [Romualdi lab website](http://romualdi.bio.unipd.it/)

**Nicola Vitulo** is an Associate Professor at the University of Verona, Department of Biotechnology. His work as a computational biologist began on 2002. During these years he had acquired a robust expertise in bioinformatics focusing on gene prediction and annotation, gene expression analysis, comparative genomics and data managment. He had worked for many years in the genomic area developing a strong interest for many aspects of this field, especially focusing on the innovations and challenges introduced by the NGS technologies.
Prof. Vitulo is currently involved in several metagenomics and metabarcoding projects to study the correlation between the composition of the gut microbiota and diseases

**Giovanni Birolo** is the lead bioinformatician at the Genome Variation Unit at the University of Turin. After a degree in Maths and a PhD in logic, he joined the exciting field of bioinformatics focusing on population genetics and genomics.
