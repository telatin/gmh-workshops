## :bust_in_silhouette: Speakers bio

**Chiara Romualdi** is an Associate Professor at the University of Padova, Department of Biology, and she is the PI of a computational biology group since 2005. Her research activity is mostly focused on the development of computational methods for the analysis of transcriptome data in the filed of cancer genomic. In the last years she has worked on the implementation of new methods for pathway and network analyses, with a focus on data integration. She is currently involved in several projects to study cancer heterogeneity and the cross-talk between tumor and immune cells. See also: [Romualdi lab website](http://romualdi.bio.unipd.it/)

**Nicola Vitulo** is an Associate Professor at the University of Verona, Department of Biotechnology. His work as a computational biologist began on 2002. During these years he had acquired a robust expertise in bioinformatics focusing on gene prediction and annotation, gene expression analysis, comparative genomics and data managment. He had worked for many years in the genomic area developing a strong interest for many aspects of this field, especially focusing on the innovations and challenges introduced by the NGS technologies.
Prof. Vitulo is currently involved in several metagenomics and metabarcoding projects to study the correlation between the composition of the gut microbiota and diseases

## :question: FAQs

_Can I attend only one seminar (or some seminars)?_

Yes, definitely. The two seminars on November 27th are introductory and will give you the right background to better understand the two lessons from Chiara Romualdi and Nicola Vitulo. Feel free to skip the introduction if you already have some background!

_Should I register?_

You can register from [NBI Intranet](https://intranet.nbi.ac.uk/infoserv/cgi-bin/calendar/default.asp?id=60789)

_Where is the venue?_

This is an event organized at the [Quadram Institute](https://quadram.ac.uk) in Norwich. Check the address in the ["How to find us" page](https://quadram.ac.uk/about/how-to-find-us/). The two rooms are both in the _upper ground floor_, and our reception will be glad to help you finding them.
