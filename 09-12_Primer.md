:small_blue_diamond: **A primer on data analysis with R (or Python)**

_10.00 - Dr. Giovanni Birolo (University of Turin, Italy)_

How do we make sense of datasets? We should probably start using R (and, if we code in Python, Pandas).
With our guest speaker, lead bioinformatician in the [Genomic variation unit](https://www.iigm.it/site/anteprima.php?id_app=1536&t=approfondimento&m=extra&id=337) in Turin, we will demistify the process and see how to start a new numerical workflow.
