# Data Analysis in Bioinformatics

Python and R skills for PhD Students

## Goals

 - Understand common outputs of metagenomics analyses
 - Import feature tables in R (or Python) and perform basic statistics
 - Plot the taxonomical composition of a metabarcoding/metagenomics experiment
 
## Curricula

The background of our PhD students can be different (computer science, or molecular biology/microbiology), so we can tailor our training to the specific needs of each student.
